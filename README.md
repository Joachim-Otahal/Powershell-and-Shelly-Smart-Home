# Powershell and Shelly Smart Home
There is no documentation and there are no examples how to use Shelly products with Powershell, so lets make some.

## Basic Information
All examples and are based on Powershell 5.1 which is available for Windows 7 and Server 2088 R2 up to the newest Insider builds for Windows and Windows Servers.
Depending on the age or generation of the shelly you can rpc commands, which are better organized, or the older query style.
The commands with examples for curl are listed at https://shelly-api-docs.shelly.cloud , and they can all be translated to powershell.

## Important rpc commands
Things like "How do I get a list of all available commands?"


## Shelly 3 EM Pro Command examples
How do I read the power usage, and the histoy data for a specific time frame?


## Shelly 1 Mini Gen 3 examples
Get the status, use the switch.


## Shelly Plug S (Plus)
Get status, switch it, and read the real power usage if the plug dislikes the device.
